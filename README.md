# React Employee Directory App

## Purpose

This is a employee directory aplication created with the React format. Upon launch the app will create an directory listing of twenty employees, each with a unique photo, first and last name, email address, and phone number.
My app uses the randomuser api create all of the employee information. Unfortunately this isn't deployed so if you would like to try this out for yourself you will need to download the directory folder. 

## Instructions

In Node, simply use the *"npm start"* command to launch the application.
